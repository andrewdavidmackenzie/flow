Features Used
===
* Context Flow
* `context` Functions used (`stdio/stdout``)
* Reduced syntax so that `alias` of referenced processes default to their names (`get` and `stdout`)
* Selecting a specific indexed entry of an `array` output
* Library Flows used (`args/get` from `flowstdlib`)
* Connections between functions
