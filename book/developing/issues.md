### Issues
Issues can be found in the [repo](https://github.com/andrewdavidmackenzie/flow/issues), if you are not yet a 
project contributor then just add a comment to one to say you'd like to work on it and I will avoid doing
the same. 

I work on issues KanBan style in this [Github Project](https://github.com/andrewdavidmackenzie/flow/projects/2)

Adding new issues you find can also be helpful, although with my limited time on the project, fixing issues
and sending PRs are more welcome! :-)
