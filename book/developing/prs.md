### PRs
If you want to contribute code or a test or to the book:
- if no existing issue exists for it, create one so we can agree on what to do before starting (a good idea 
to make later PR merges easier to accept I think!)
- if an issue exists already add a comment to it so I know you want to work on it
- fork the repo
- create a branch for the issue in your repo
- make your changes and update tests, code docs, the book and examples as required
- run local build and test ('make') before pushing to your branch
- wait for GH Actions on PR to pass
- submit the PR, referencing the issue is a good idea
