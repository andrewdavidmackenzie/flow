//! or runner, such as `flowr` command line runner.
//!
//! It is responsible for reading a flow definition in a `Manifest` file, loading the required
//! libraries from `LibraryManifest` files and then coordinating the execution by dispatching `Jobs`
//! to be executed by `Function` `Implementations`, providing them the `Inputs` required to run and
//! gathering the `Outputs` produced and passing those `Outputs` to other connected `Functions` in
//! the network of `Functions`.
