# `flowrlib`

This is the rust run-time library for flow execution. This will be linked with other code to produce a flow
 runner, such as the `flowr` command line runner.

It is responsible for reading a flow definition in a `Manifest` file, loading the required libraries 
from `LibraryManifest` files and then coordinating the execution by dispatching `Jobs` to be executed 
by `Function` `Implementations`, providing them the `Inputs` required to run and gathering the `Outputs` produced 
and passing those `Outputs` to other connected `Functions` in the network of `Functions`.

## features
These are the conditionally compiled features of `flowrlib`:
- default - none are activated by default
- submission - include the ability to receive a submission of a flow for execution
- context - makes this crate aware of the flow context functions or not
- debugger - feature to add the debugger
- metrics - feature for tracking of metrics during execution
