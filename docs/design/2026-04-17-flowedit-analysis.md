# flowedit — Visual Flow Editor: Analysis & Design

## 1. Overview

A new `flowedit` binary that provides a WYSIWYG canvas-based editor for creating, editing,
and running flow programs. Built on iced 0.14 with the Canvas widget for custom node/connection
rendering. Shares code with existing libraries (flowcore, flowrlib, flowstdlib) and reuses
patterns from flowrgui.

## 2. UI Layout

### Layout Description

- **Menu bar** — File (New, Open, Save, Save As), Edit (Undo, Redo, Delete), Flow (Compile,
  Run, Stop), Help
- **Left panel: Process Library** — tree view of all available processes discovered from
  libraries found on `FLOW_LIB_PATH` (or specified via `-L` CLI option), grouped by library.
  Context functions are treated as a library. User can drag a process onto the canvas to add it.
- **Center: Canvas** — the main editing area where flow nodes are drawn and connected
- **Bottom panel: I/O Tabs** — reused from flowrgui's TabSet (stdout, stderr, stdin, fileio,
  images) for flow execution output
- **Status bar** — current state: Ready (editing), Compiling, or Running
  (Running may have future sub-states like Paused via debugger).
  Errors are displayed as messages, not a state.

## 3. Node Rendering

Each process on the canvas is rendered as a rounded rectangle ("bubble"):

```
         ┌─────────────────────┐
         │     sequence        │
         │                     │
    ○────│  start       number │────○
    ○────│  step               │
    ○────│  limit              │
         │                     │
         └─────────────────────┘
         ↑                     ↑
    Input ports            Output port
    (left edge)           (right edge)
```

### Node Details

- **Title**: process alias (or function name if no alias) centered at top
- **Input ports**: small circles on the left edge, labeled with port name
- **Output ports**: small circles on the right edge, labeled with port name
- **Hover behavior**: hovering over a port shows a tooltip with the port's data type(s)
- **Selection**: clicking a node selects it (highlighted border). Selected nodes can be
  moved, resized, or deleted.
- **Resize**: drag handles on corners/edges of the node rectangle
- **Colors**: different fill colors for different process types:
  - Library functions: blue
  - Context functions: green
  - Nested flows: orange
  - Provided implementations (custom code compiled to WASM): purple

### Nested Flow Nodes

When a process references another flow definition, it appears as a node with a double border.
Double-clicking it opens that flow in a new editor window/tab. In the nested editor:
- Flow inputs appear as port connectors on the left edge of the canvas
- Flow outputs appear as port connectors on the right edge of the canvas

## 4. Connection Rendering & Interaction

Connections are drawn as bezier curves between output and input ports:

```
    ┌──────────┐                    ┌──────────┐
    │ sequence │                    │  stdout  │
    │          │                    │          │
    │   number ○───╮          ╭───→○ default  │
    │          │    ╰────────╯     │          │
    └──────────┘                    └──────────┘
```

### Connection Drawing

- Bezier curve with control points calculated automatically based on horizontal distance
  between ports (similar to iced bezier_tool example)
- Connection color: default gray, highlighted on hover/selection
- Arrow head on the destination (input) end

### Connection Interaction

1. **Creating**: Click an output port → line follows cursor as bezier curve → release on
   compatible input port. Can also start from input port and drag to output port.
2. **Compatibility**: When dragging, only type-compatible ports are highlighted and
   selectable. Incompatible ports are dimmed. Type compatibility uses the same rules as
   `flowc` compiler including implicit conversions.
3. **Reconnecting**: Click and drag an existing connection endpoint to move it to a different
   compatible port.
4. **Selecting**: Click a connection line to select it (highlighted).
5. **Deleting**: Select a connection, then press Delete or use Edit menu.

## 5. Data Model

### EditorFlow — the in-memory representation

```rust
struct EditorFlow {
    definition: FlowDefinition,    // from flowcore — the flow definition
    layout: FlowLayout,            // visual layout metadata
    dirty: bool,                   // unsaved changes
    file_path: Option<PathBuf>,    // where this flow is saved
}

struct FlowLayout {
    nodes: HashMap<String, NodeLayout>,  // keyed by process alias
}

struct NodeLayout {
    x: f32,
    y: f32,
    width: f32,
    height: f32,
}
```

### Persistence — layout in flow definition

Layout metadata is stored as optional fields in the `[[process]]` entries of the flow
definition file:

```toml
[[process]]
alias = "sequence"
source = "lib://flowstdlib/math/sequence"
input.start = { once = 1 }
input.limit = { once = 9 }
# Visual layout (used by flowedit, ignored by flowc)
x = 100.0
y = 200.0
width = 180.0
height = 120.0
```

This requires adding optional `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` fields to `ProcessReference` in
flowcore. The compiler (`flowc`) will parse but ignore these fields. The
`#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if)]` pattern ensures they're only written when present.

## 6. Process Library Panel

The left panel shows available processes in a tree structure, organized by library.

### Library Discovery

Libraries are discovered by scanning the **flow lib search path** (`FLOW_LIB_PATH` or
`~/.flow/lib` by default). Each directory in the path that contains a `lib.json` manifest
is a library. `flowstdlib` is not special-cased — it's just another library found via this
path. If it's not installed, its functions simply won't appear.

### Tree Structure

```
Libraries
├── flowstdlib/
│   ├── math/
│   │   ├── add
│   │   ├── subtract
│   │   ├── multiply
│   │   └── sequence
│   ├── control/
│   │   ├── select
│   │   └── tap
│   ├── data/
│   │   ├── accumulate
│   │   └── append
│   └── ...
├── mylib/                    (user-installed library)
│   ├── filters/
│   │   └── lowpass
│   └── transforms/
│       └── fft
└── Context/
    └── stdio/
        ├── stdin
        ├── stdout
        └── stderr
```

Each library is loaded from its manifest, which describes its available functions/flows
with their input/output signatures. Context functions are discovered from the runner
specification.

### Interaction

The user can:
- Browse the tree
- Search/filter by name
- Drag a process onto the canvas to add it
- Double-click to add it at a default position

When a process is added, a new `ProcessReference` is created in the flow definition with
the appropriate `lib://` or `context://` source URL and default layout coordinates.

## 7. Architecture & Code Reuse

### New crate structure

```
flowr/src/bin/flowedit/
├── main.rs              # Application entry, CLI args, iced::application builder
├── editor.rs            # Main editor state, update/view
├── canvas_view.rs       # Canvas widget — node/connection rendering & interaction
├── library_panel.rs     # Process library tree view
├── menu.rs              # Menu bar
└── model.rs             # EditorFlow, NodeLayout, editor-specific data types
```

### Reuse from existing code

| Component | Source | How |
|-----------|--------|-----|
| I/O Tabs (stdout, stderr, etc.) | flowrgui/tabs.rs | Import directly or extract to shared module |
| Flow execution | flowrlib (Coordinator, Dispatcher, Executor) | Same as flowrgui |
| Flow compilation | flowrclib (compile, parser) | Use as library |
| Flow definition model | flowcore (FlowDefinition, etc.) | Direct dependency |
| Coordinator connection | flowrgui/connection_manager.rs | Reuse pattern |
| Type compatibility | flowcore/model/datatype.rs | `DataType::compatible_types()` |
| Serialization | flowcore/deserializers | TOML/YAML/JSON roundtrip |

### Changes to existing code

1. **flowcore: ProcessReference** — add optional `x`, `y`, `width`, `height` fields with
   serde defaults
2. **flowcore: FlowDefinition** — no changes needed, processes already stored by alias
3. **flowstdlib** — add a public API to enumerate available functions and their signatures
   (currently the manifest is loaded at runtime, but we need it at edit time too)
4. **flowr/Cargo.toml** — add `[[bin]] name = "flowedit"` entry

## 8. Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Canvas with static nodes (2-3 days)

**Goal**: Render a hardcoded flow as nodes on a canvas. No interaction yet.

**Work**:
- Create `flowedit` binary skeleton with iced::application
- Implement canvas rendering: rounded rectangles for nodes, circles for ports, labels
- Load a flow definition file (e.g., `hello-world/root.toml`) and render it
- Draw connections as bezier curves between ports

**Tests**: Canvas renders without crashing. Flow definition loads correctly. Visual
verification by running the editor.

**Deliverable**: A read-only flow viewer.

### Phase 2: Node interaction (2-3 days)

**Goal**: Select, move, and resize nodes on the canvas.

**Work**:
- Hit testing for nodes and ports (point-in-rectangle, point-near-circle)
- Node selection (click to select, click canvas to deselect)
- Node dragging (click and drag to move, connections follow)
- Node deletion (select + delete key)
- Zoom and pan on the canvas

**Tests**: Node positions update after drag. Connections redraw correctly. Delete removes
node from flow definition.

**Deliverable**: Interactive flow viewer with moveable nodes.

### Phase 3: Connection creation (2-3 days)

**Goal**: Create and delete connections between ports by dragging.

**Work**:
- Port hit testing (identify which port is under cursor)
- Connection drag interaction (bezier curve from port to cursor)
- Type compatibility highlighting (compatible ports glow, others dim)
- Connection completion (release on compatible port creates connection)
- Connection selection and deletion
- Connection reconnection (drag endpoint to new port)

**Tests**: Connection created between compatible ports. Connection rejected between
incompatible ports. Connection appears in flow definition. Deletion removes from definition.

**Deliverable**: Full connection editing.

### Phase 4: Process library & adding nodes (2-3 days)

**Goal**: Browse available processes and add them to the canvas.

**Work**:
- Left panel with tree view of flowstdlib functions and context functions
- Drag from library to canvas to add a process
- Process added to flow definition with default inputs
- Input initializer editing (click on port to set once/always value)

**Tests**: Process added to canvas and flow definition. Library shows all stdlib functions.
Initializer values saved correctly.

**Deliverable**: Can create flows from scratch using library functions.

### Phase 5: Save/Load & compile/run (2-3 days)

**Goal**: Save flows to TOML files with layout, compile and run them.

**Work**:
- File menu: New, Open, Save, Save As (TOML format with layout fields)
- Layout fields (x, y, width, height) added to ProcessReference in flowcore
- Flow menu: Compile (using flowc as library), Run (using flowrlib)
- Bottom I/O tabs for execution output (reused from flowrgui)
- Status bar showing editor state

**Tests**: Save and reload produces identical flow. Compile succeeds for valid flow.
Run produces expected output. Layout preserved across save/load cycles.

**Deliverable**: Fully functional flow editor that can create, save, compile, and run flows.

### Phase 6: Nested flows & polish (2-3 days)

**Goal**: Support nested flow editing and UI polish.

**Work**:
- Double-click flow node to open nested editor
- Nested editor shows flow inputs on left edge, outputs on right edge
- Undo/redo support
- Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+S save, Delete, Ctrl+Z undo)
- Error display for compilation failures
- Flow metadata editing (name, description, authors)

**Tests**: Nested flow can be edited and saved. Undo/redo works for node moves, connection
changes, and process additions. Metadata saved correctly.

**Deliverable**: Production-ready flow editor.

## 9. Key Design Decisions

1. **New binary, not extending flowrgui** — keeps things clean, can replace flowrgui later
2. **Canvas widget for rendering** — full control over node/connection drawing
3. **Layout stored in flow definition** — optional fields on process references, single file
4. **Bezier curves for connections** — following iced bezier_tool example pattern
5. **Drag-to-connect interaction** — with type compatibility highlighting
6. **Phase-based implementation** — each phase produces working, testable software
7. **stdlib + context functions first** — custom implementations in a later issue
