## Running flows with `flowr`

In order to run a flow, it must first be compiled. Then a "flow runner" such as `flowr`can be used to run the compiled
flow manifest).

Flow runners in general and `flowr` run the compiled flow manifest (by default named `manifest.json`).

In order to compile a flow definition down to a flow manifest that can be run, you use `flowc` as usual, with the
addition of the `-c, --compile` option. This compiles the flow but does not invoke `flowr` to run it.

Then `flowr` as described below can be used to run the compiled flow.

This section describes command line arguments that can be supplied to `flowr` and what they are useful for.

### Getting help
Use `-h, --help` (e.g. `flowc -h` or `cargo run -p flowc -- -h`) to print out help for the usage of `flowc`. 

This will print something like this:
```shell script 
Usage: flowr [OPTIONS] [flow-manifest] [flow_args]...

Arguments:
  [flow-manifest]  the file path of the 'flow' manifest file
  [flow_args]...   A list of arguments to pass to the flow.

Options:
  -d, --debugger                     Enable the debugger when running a flow
  -m, --metrics                      Calculate metrics during flow execution and print them out when done
  -n, --native                       Link with native (not WASM) version of flowstdlib
  -s, --server                       Launch flowr with a coordinator only, no client
  -c, --client <port>                Launch flowr with a client only, no coordinator, to connect to a flowr coordinator
  -C, --context                      Execute only 'context' (not general) jobs in the coordinator
  -j, --jobs <MAX_JOBS>              Set maximum number of jobs that can be running in parallel)
  -L, --libdir <LIB_DIR|BASE_URL>    Add a directory or base Url to the Library Search path
  -t, --threads <THREADS>            Set number of threads to use to execute jobs (min: 1, default: cores available)
  -v, --verbosity <VERBOSITY_LEVEL>  Set verbosity level for output (trace, debug, info, warn, default: error)
  -h, --help                         Print help information
  -V, --version                      Print version information
```

Similarly to [flowc](flowc.md), in order to locate libraries used in flow execution, `flowr` needs to know where to 
locate them. As for flowc, this can be done using the `$FLOW_LIB_PATH` environment variable, or one or more instance
of the `-L, --libdir <LIB_DIR|BASE_URL>` option.

### `flow-manifest`
After the Options you can supply an optional field for where to load the root flow from. This can be a relative or 
absolute path when no Url scheme is used, an absolute path if the `file://` scheme is used or a web resources if
either the `http` or `https` scheme is used.
* If no argument is supplied, it assumes the current directory as the argument, and continues as below
* If it's a directory then it attempts to load "root.toml" from within the directory
* If it's a file then it attempts to load the root flow from that file

### `flow_args`
Any arguments after `flow-manifest` are assumed to be arguments for the flow itself. When it starts executing it can
retrieve the value of these parameters using `context functions`.

### Example Invocations
For each of these examples, there is first a `flowc` line showing how the flow can be compiled. This will leave
a compiled `manifest.json` flow manifest alongside the flow's root definition file. That manifest is then run using
`flowr`

- `flowc -C flowr/src/bin/flowrcli/context -c flowr/examples/fibonacci` - compile the fibonacci example
- `flowr flowr/examples/fibonacci` - run the pre-compiled fibonacci example flow manifest
    - You should get a fibonacci series output to the terminal,
- `unset FLOW_LIB_PATH;flowc -C flowr/src/bin/flowrcli/context -c -L $HOME/.flow/lib flowr/examples/fibonacci` - compile the flow
- `unset FLOW_LIB_PATH;flowr -L $HOME/.flow/lib flowr/examples/fibonacci` - 
    - You should get a fibonacci series output to the terminal,
- `flowc -C flowr/src/bin/flowrcli/context -c flowr/examples/sequence` - compile the flow
- `flowr flowr/examples/sequence 10` - compile the flow
    - A short sequence of numbers (2, 5, 8) and a string will be printed. The "10" represents the maximum of the sequence.
- `flowr flowr/examples/sequence/manifest.json 10` - compile the flow, specifying the full path to the manifest.json file
