## Debugging your first flow

### Command line options to `flowc`
When running `flowc` using `cargo run -p flowc` you should add `--` to mark the end of the options passed to cargo, 
and the start of the options passed to `flowc`

You can see what they are using `--help` producing output similar to this:

```bash
cargo run -p flowc -- --help                         
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.12s
     Running 'target/debug/flowc --help'
flowc 0.8.8

USAGE:
    flowc [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] [--] [ARGS]

FLAGS:
    -d, --dump        Dump the flow to .dump files after loading it
    -z, --graphs      Create .dot files for graph generation
    -h, --help        Prints help information
    -p, --provided    Provided function implementations should NOT be compiled from source
    -s, --skip        Skip execution of flow
    -g, --symbols     Generate debug symbols (like process names and full routes)
    -V, --version     Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -L, --libdir <LIB_DIR|BASE_URL>...    Add a directory or base Url to the Library Search path
    -o, --output <OUTPUT_DIR>             Specify the output directory for generated manifest
    -i, --stdin <STDIN_FILENAME>          Read STDIN from the named file
    -v, --verbosity <VERBOSITY_LEVEL>     Set verbosity level for output (trace, debug, info, warn, error (default))

ARGS:
    <FLOW>            the name of the 'flow' definition file or library to compile
    <flow_args>...    Arguments that will get passed onto the flow if it is executed

```

### Command line options to `flowrcli`
By default `flowc` uses `flowrcli` to run the flow once it has compiled it. Also it defaults to passing the `-n/--native`
flag to `flowrcli` so that flows are executed using the native implementations of library functions.

In order to pass command line options on to `flowrcli` you separate them from the options to `flowc` after another `--` separator.

`flowrcli` accepts the same `-v/--verbosity` verbosity options as `flowc`.

### Getting debug output
If you want to follow what the run-time is doing in more detail, you can increase the verbosity level (default level is ERROR)
using the `-v/--verbosity` option.

So, if you want to walk through each and every step of the flow's execution, similar to the previous [step by step section](step-by-step.md) 
then you can do so by using `-v debug` and piping the output to `more` (as there is a lot of output!):
 
 `cargo run -p flowc -- flowr/examples/fibonacci -- -v debug| more`

which should produce output similar to this:
