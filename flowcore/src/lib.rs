/// ```
/// use flowcore::{Implementation, RUN_AGAIN, RunAgain};
/// use flowcore::errors::Result;
/// use serde_json::Value;
/// use serde_json::json;
///
/// #[derive(Debug)]
/// pub struct Compare;

///     A compare implementation that takes two numbers and outputs the comparisons between them

///         let left = inputs[0].as_i64().unwrap();
///         let right = inputs[1].as_i64().unwrap();
///
///         let output = json!({
///                     "equal" : left == right,
///                     "lt" : left < right,
///                     "gt" : left > right,

///         Ok((None, RUN_AGAIN))

/// `flowmacro` crate to simplify input gathering and to hide the boiler plate code around the
/// function implementing the logic.
