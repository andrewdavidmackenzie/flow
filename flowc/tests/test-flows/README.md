## Flowc Parser and Compiler Test flows

These are a number of test flows to exercise specific features of `flowc`'s parser and compiler and are not intended
to be "real world programs" or solutions to problems.

They are contained in the [flowc/tests/test-flows](https://github.com/andrewdavidmackenzie/flow/tree/master/flowc/tests/test-flows)
folder in the code.

To understand each test, see the test code in:
- [flowc-compiler_tests.rs](https://github.com/andrewdavidmackenzie/flow/tree/master/flowc/tests/flowc-compiler_tests.rs)
- [flowc-parser_tests.rs](https://github.com/andrewdavidmackenzie/flow/tree/master/flowc/tests/flowc-parser_tests.rs)
