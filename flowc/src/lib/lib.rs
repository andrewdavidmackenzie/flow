//! This is the rust `flow` Compiler Library. It can be linked with other code to produce
//! a flow compiler, such as the `flowc` command line flow compiler.

/// reads [flow definitions][flowcore::model::flow_definition] into memory, flattens and connects
/// that into a graph of [runtime functions][flowcore::model::runtime_function::RuntimeFunction]
pub mod compiler;

/// used to output a human readable version of the model and compiler tables to help debug
/// compiler problems
pub mod dumper;

/// takes care of generating the [flow's manifest][flowcore::model::flow_manifest::FlowManifest]
/// (for later execution by a flow runner) from the [compiler tables][compiler::compile::CompilerTables]
pub mod generator;

/// provides methods to get information about this version of the flowrclib library
pub mod info;

/// contains [errors::Error] that other modules in this crate will `use errors::*;`
/// to get access to everything `error_chain` creates.
